flappy bird jam



required
---------------
bugs:
	sometimes get stuck on the staticbody bottom, seems like inbuilt physics quirk. maybe have the bottom bounce?
---------------

character controller polish, probably after sprites/collisions are more set

art stuff:
	border on top & bottom (that kill or bounce)
	background
	clean up the obstacle trees (top part the birds?)
	particles on death and stuff would be rad

difficulty system
	scaling probably, level system?
	
	variables:
		-gap size
		-distance gap moves vertically each obstacle
		-speed of obstacle movement (reaction time)
		-speed of obstacle spawn (space/inputs to move vertically)
		-player/obstacle size (zoom camera?)
		
	i could do infinite scaling until it's mathematically impossible, and the goal is to get as far, as many times, as consistently as you can
		-fast paced
		-obvious game end
		-depends on gap spawn luck?
	i could do bounded scaling (levels)
		-guaranteed to be doable
		-not obvious ending
		-steady progression
	can play particles or skip to either level



gap issue (sometimes goes off screen up top, never on bottom)





notes
---------------
probably should destroy player on hitting the bottom
and have clouds on the top as collision? or maybe just push player back aggressively (can check for player input and give opposite*1.25 thrust)

hot air baloon: endurance mode where you have limited fuel?

setup a group bus script, i have magic strings
---------------


polish
---------------
better player movement
	-can check if velocity.y > 0, if so reduces velocity.y by a percentage (50%)? - it instantly cuts aggressive falls on button press
	-check in on player size
	-check in on controls, maybe there should be a cooldown or something on flaps
	-have that fire tween in and out, size and/or alpha
	-particle effects/fire on input, could help it feel good
	
better respawn
	-have score show in center of screen or something for a bit while you respawn (it's easy to miss and it clears quickly)
	-have the player grow in or something, instead of just appearing

better obstacles
	have the size of the gap more interesting - normal distribution to a reasonable size? better tuned size?
	roll 1-100, 20% random placement, 40% in line, large gap; 20% in line, small gap; 20% moving? increase odds of difficulty as you progress?
	could have the individual obstacles bob up and down a little (on higher difficulties?) - maybe just the sprite?

better pacing
	zoom out, speed up over time?
	save and show highest score?
	have "levels" or checkpoints - every 5 or so obstacles there's a harder one, then you progress to a harder difficulty?
		have a "skip levels" checkbox for experience player - on pause menu?
		
powerups? pillar smashing?

better art :D
	fix tree to be 3:1
	have the top be not a tree
	have the bottom & top trees/clouds or whatever
	have a background :D maybe noise?
	
probably a pause menu or feature

have outer walls not be solid, maybe have some sort of push-back force, or at least an indicator that you're off screen like an arrow

spin out death - two tweens, one for rotation(infinite), and one to shrink scale to 0.05; then kill both and player node

sound effects and stuff
