flappy bird jam



required
---------------

every few seconds, spawn an obstacle with scaled y
	decide both obstacles heights together, then give randomly to top or bottom
		maybe decide gap, not obstacle height?
	if top, rotate 180
		make sure obstacle pivot is at the bottom, not the center
			maybe a "base node" and then sprite/colliders that grow out?
		or just scale, then move vertically by half, for now, no need to rotate
maybe have obstacles stop spawning when dead?


obstacle spawning:
	1. obstacle spawn point at center of screen (y=360)
		this is the center of the gap
		move this randomly up and down (to margins, 0.25->0.75 probably)
		spawn obstacles around this center
		every "obstacle" object has two parts, the top and bottom - and a "gap" variable which determines how far apart they are
		
		this spawn point oscillates with its own script, that changes over time to move between top/bottom more quickly. probably non-linear changes, have it jump around a bit




have some sort of speed up or high-score-time-survived

bugs:
	sometimes get stuck on the staticbody bottom, seems like inbuilt physics quirk. maybe have the bottom bounce?
---------------















notes
---------------
have a defined external colour palette

pipes: roll 1-100, 20% random placement, 40% in line, large gap; 20% in line, small gap; 20% moving? increase odds of difficulty as you progress?

obstacles: probably have a top sprite and a body sprite, with the body sprite tiling

setup a group bus script, i have magic strings

have game zoom out or in as you progress?
---------------


polish
---------------
have a background :D maybe noise?

have outer walls not be solid, maybe have some sort of push-back force, or at least an indicator that you're off screen like an arrow

rotate with force -> call to update the rotation tween on input and on process, and have it update the tween

spin out death - two tweens, one for rotation(infinite), and one to shrink scale to 0.05; then kill both and player node

could have the individual obstacles bob up and down a little (on higher difficulties?)
