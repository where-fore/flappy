flappy bird jam

timer every hour or so, write what i did, and stretch a bit
probably prepare some food (chili+bread), cut hair as a break
i could do some thorough document planning, but i think i'd rather sorta wing this one and next project dive on the management - i still want to focus on getting comfortable navigating godot and its documentation
	still do some outlining of course, but i don't want to go get a doc and repurpose it

have outer walls not be solid, maybe have some sort of push-back force, or at least an indicator that you're off screen like an arrow

pipes: roll 1-100, 20% random placement, 40% in line, large gap; 20% in line, small gap; 20% moving? increase odds of difficulty as you progress?
