notes
---------------
have a defined external colour palette

pipes: roll 1-100, 20% random placement, 40% in line, large gap; 20% in line, small gap; 20% moving? increase odds of difficulty as you progress?

obstacles: probably have a top sprite and a body sprite, with the body sprite tiling

setup a group bus script, i have magic strings

polish
---------------
have outer walls not be solid, maybe have some sort of push-back force, or at least an indicator that you're off screen like an arrow

rotate with force -> call to update the rotation tween on input and on process, and have it update the tween

spin out death - two tweens, one for rotation(infinite), and one to shrink scale to 0.05; then kill both and player node
