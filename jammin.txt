flappy bird jam



required
---------------
have some sort of speed up and/or high-score-time-survived




bugs:
	sometimes get stuck on the staticbody bottom, seems like inbuilt physics quirk. maybe have the bottom bounce?
---------------



could grab parent of each obstacle
	this means the method gets called twice
	unless i somehow remove duplicates

could group parents permantently as "obstacle container"
	seems unnecessary for one function?











notes
---------------
have a defined external colour palette

pipes: roll 1-100, 20% random placement, 40% in line, large gap; 20% in line, small gap; 20% moving? increase odds of difficulty as you progress?

obstacles: probably have a top sprite and a body sprite, with the body sprite tiling

setup a group bus script, i have magic strings

have game zoom out or in as you progress?

polish
---------------
better player movement
	can clamp y velocity instead of the anti-bounce (and so you can have aggressive gravity without insane dipping)
	lots of other tweaking, probably watch a video or browse all my available levers and pull them all

better respawn
	have score show in center of screen or something for a bit while you respawn (it's easy to miss and it clears quickly)
	have the player grow in instead of just appearing


have a background :D maybe noise?

have outer walls not be solid, maybe have some sort of push-back force, or at least an indicator that you're off screen like an arrow

rotate with force -> call to update the rotation tween on input and on process, and have it update the tween

spin out death - two tweens, one for rotation(infinite), and one to shrink scale to 0.05; then kill both and player node

maybe have obstacles stop spawning when dead?

could have the individual obstacles bob up and down a little (on higher difficulties?)
