flappy bird jam



required
---------------
bugs:
	sometimes get stuck on the staticbody bottom, seems like inbuilt physics quirk. maybe have the bottom bounce?
---------------

-character controller
	tried holding space and it didn't feel right - would rather a meaty jump on press
	
	currently fighting gravity feels bad - pressing space while falling does little when it feels like it should do a lot, and to just go straight requires upkeep(this can feel good but not always)
	






-consider what i want the difficulty in the game to be, and design around that (re: pong paddles having fixed movement speed)
	-hard to change direction so i have to plan ahead - generous gaps but ungenerous placement of gaps vertically. can see many obstacles. fighting the random layout with your planning and movement
		-obstacles slower movement
		-smaller character
		-gap system: larger minimum/average gap, lots of variations
	-easy to change direction, snappy nice movement - but gaps are difficult. fighting the tight corridors with your movement






notes
---------------
probably should destroy player on hitting the bottom
and have clouds on the top as collision? or maybe just push player back aggressively (can check for player input and give opposite*1.25 thrust)

hot air baloon: endurance mode where you have limited fuel?

setup a group bus script, i have magic strings

polish

mobile controls for alex :D

better player movement
	-can clamp y velocity instead of the anti-bounce (and so you can have aggressive gravity without insane dipping)
	-lots of other tweaking, probably watch a video or browse all my available levers and pull them all
	-check in on player size, it feels a little big at the moment?
	-check in on controls, maybe there should be a cooldown or something on flaps
	
better respawn
	have score show in center of screen or something for a bit while you respawn (it's easy to miss and it clears quickly)
	have the player grow in instead of just appearing

better obstacles
	have the central gap move around, to make little paths
	have the size of the gap more interesting - normal distribution to a reasonable size? better tuned size?
	roll 1-100, 20% random placement, 40% in line, large gap; 20% in line, small gap; 20% moving? increase odds of difficulty as you progress?
	could have the individual obstacles bob up and down a little (on higher difficulties?) - maybe just the sprite?

better pacing
	zoom out, speed up over time?
	save and show highest score?
	have "levels" or checkpoints - every 5 or so obstacles there's a harder one, then you progress to a harder difficulty?
		have a "skip levels" checkbox for experience player - on pause menu?
		
powerups? pillar smashing?

have art :D
	hot air baloon and birds/trees?
	
	have a defined external colour palette
	have a background :D maybe noise?
	
probably a pause menu or feature

have outer walls not be solid, maybe have some sort of push-back force, or at least an indicator that you're off screen like an arrow

rotate with force -> call to update the rotation tween on input and on process, and have it update the tween

spin out death - two tweens, one for rotation(infinite), and one to shrink scale to 0.05; then kill both and player node
