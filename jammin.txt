flappy bird jam



required
---------------

have spawner point at top and bottom (outside of view)
	put them in "top" and "bottom groups"
every few seconds, spawn an obstacle with scaled y
	decide both obstacles heights together, then give randomly to top or bottom
		maybe decide gap, not obstacle height?
	if top, rotate 180
		make sure obstacle pivot is at the bottom, not the center
			maybe a "base node" and then sprite/colliders that grow out?
		or just scale, then move vertically by half, for now, no need to rotate
have obstacles always move -x at constant speed
	destroy when out of viewport by an amount (> outside of view above)
have player respawn in center left after dying
	maybe have obstacles stop spawning when dead?

can zoom camera out for now to test
add lil colour to outer walls for debug




have some sort of speed up or high-score-time-survived

bugs:
	sometimes get stuck on the staticbody bottom, seems like inbuilt physics quirk. maybe have the bottom bounce?
---------------















notes
---------------
have a defined external colour palette

pipes: roll 1-100, 20% random placement, 40% in line, large gap; 20% in line, small gap; 20% moving? increase odds of difficulty as you progress?

obstacles: probably have a top sprite and a body sprite, with the body sprite tiling

setup a group bus script, i have magic strings

have game zoom out or in as you progress?
---------------


polish
---------------
have a background :D maybe noise?

have outer walls not be solid, maybe have some sort of push-back force, or at least an indicator that you're off screen like an arrow

rotate with force -> call to update the rotation tween on input and on process, and have it update the tween

spin out death - two tweens, one for rotation(infinite), and one to shrink scale to 0.05; then kill both and player node
